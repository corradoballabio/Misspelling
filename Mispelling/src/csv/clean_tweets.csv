an important article by ahead of thursdays crucial london mayoral election please rt
the facts are clear nicola will be first minister amp only ruth is strong enough to hold her to account
its clear that only ruth davidson is strong enough to hold nicola sturgeon to account
the is clearly between ruth and nicola with kezia just watching from the sidelines
kezia on tax
its not on ruth to nicola on the snps relentless focus on independence at the expense of good government for scotland
ruth shows she will stand up to nicola and get the snp to focus on things like jobs schools amp health
clear that only one leader is behind the uk and can keep the snp in check ruth davidson
first she supports independence then claims shes against it how can kezia possibly keep the snp in check
kezia seems to forget what she recently said on too weak to hold the snp to account
ruth going head to head with nicola and holding her to account on her governments record on jobs
