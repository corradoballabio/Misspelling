25. Because the choice at this election is between a Labour government or five more years of the Tories.
24. Because we are determined to tackle climate change and create a million green jobs.
23. We will freeze rail fares in the first year of a Labour government while we reform the railways.
22. We'll get a fairer deal for renters: we'll ban rip-off letting fees and cap rents at rate of inflation for secure three-year tenancies.
21. We'll freeze energy bills until 2017. No-one should have to choose between heating and eating.
20. Because we will end rip-off prices on services that people rely on.
"19. We'll deliver smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds to give all children the best start."
"18. (2/2) We'll improve technical education and careers advice. If you chose not to go to uni, your future should be as secure as if you do."
18. (1/2) We will make sure that there is an apprenticeship for any school leaver that gets the grades.
"17. We will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 (which will help students and is also good for our economy)."
16. Because we are the party that cares about creating opportunities for all young people.
15. We will stop Tory privatisation of the NHS and cap the profits private companies can make from providing NHS services.
14. We will improve mental health care by prioritising investment in under-18s and making sure teachers are trained to spot problems early.
13. We'll train and recruit 20k more nurses and 8k more doctors by 2020. You'll have a GP appt within 48hrs-and on the same day if needed.
"12. In five years of Tory-led government we've seen rising waiting times, increasing privatisation and falling standards."
"11. Labour founded the NHS in 1948, it is one of our party's proudest achievements, and we have saved it from crisis before."
10. Because we are the party that will save the NHS.
9. We will control immigration with fair rules and make it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers.
8. We will extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours a week for working parents of three- and four-year-olds.
7. We will scrap the Bedroom Tax (from day one) that hits the disabled and most vulnerable in society.
"6. We will cut the deficit every year and balance the books, sensibly and fairly, without the extreme spending cuts the Tories have planned."
5. We'll clamp down on tax avoidance and ban 'non-dom' status (which was created in 1799 and a lot has changed since then...).
4. We won't give tax breaks to millionaires. We'll cut tax for millions of people on low and middle incomes instead.
3. We'll ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so anyone working regular hours for more than 12 weeks can get a regular contract.
2. We'll raise the minimum wage to more than £8 by October 2019 and promote the living wage.
"1. Because we will stand up for everyone, not just a privileged few."
